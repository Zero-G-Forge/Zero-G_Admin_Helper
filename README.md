## This Master Operational Registry establishes the foundational protocols for the Zero-G Admin Helper (ZAH) project.
 These constraints are active and globally enforced across this workspace.
 
* **I. Core Instructional Protocols**
    These protocols govern interaction, information processing, and project focus.
    
    Protocol Layer/Operational Enforcement
        -Categorized Structure 
            All output must utilize Markdown headers, tables, and bullet points. Dense prose is prohibited.
        -Educational Composition
            Logic mechanics and the "why" must be explained before providing any technical implementation.
        -Attachment Priority
            Newly uploaded files are audited and ingested before addressing any inquiry.
        
* **II. The Code-Gate & Pacing System**
    These protocols govern the flow of technical implementation and code disclosure to ensure manual learning.
    
    Protocol Layer/Operational Enforcement
        -The Code-Gate
            All complete scripts, classes, and modules are withheld behind a conceptual gate.
        -Gate Authorization
            Technical code blocks are only displayed upon explicit user confirmation (e.g., "Open Code-Gate").
        -Flexible Check-Ins
            I halt entirely at the end of every conceptual answer to request clearance before proceeding.
        -Manual Pacing
            Implementation is performed one unit (method/class) at a time to build programming muscle memory.
        -Sync Reminder
            Every code interaction concludes with a requirement to perform a git snap to lock the stable milestone.
            
* **III. Operational Coding Constraints**
    These rules ensure codebase integrity and maintainability.

    -Minimalist Changes: Modify only what is strictly necessary to achieve the objective.
    -Comment Continuity: Retain all original # comments.
    -Instructional Documentation: Add new # comments for instructional purposes (neutral, third-person phrasing only).
    -Debug Visibility: Maintain print() statements for all critical logic gates and data parsing steps for terminal transparency.

# Zero-G Admin Helper (v1.0-Alpha)

An immersive, high-tech sci-fi standalone desktop administration station designed to monitor a dedicated Empyrion Galactic Survival game server environment and handle live, in-game administration operations.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Stack & Framework Constraints

* **Framework:** PyQt6 (Strict usage of scoped enum namespaces like `Qt.AlignmentFlag` and `Qt.Orientation`).
* **Root Workspace Path:** `/mnt/Zero-G_Files/Zero-G_Admin_Helper`
* **Line Terminations:** All outbound server commands must use `\r\n` line terminations paired with a 500ms input buffer delay to match GTX Gaming hardware calibrations.

---

## 🌌 Aesthetic Identity & UI Guidelines

The interface moves completely away from traditional flat, corporate grey layouts to model an immersive starship cockpit HUD utilizing custom widget textures:
* **Deep Space Backgrounds:** Shadowy Marine Blue (`#001A33` / RGB: 0, 26, 51).
* **Neon Accent Tones:** Bright Cerulean Blue (`#1DACD6` / RGB: 29, 172, 214) and Vivid Cerulean (`#007BA7` / RGB: 0, 123, 167).
* **UI Integrity:** Strict reliance on QSS (Qt Style Sheets) border-image properties. This is mandated to prevent high-detail vector asset corner-brackets and custom neon glow textures from warping or stretching across variable monitor resolutions.
* **Fixed Dimensions:** The application orchestrator expects an initial canvas resolution layout of 1000x750 pixels, while specific configuration components like the AccountOnboardingWizard enforce a fixed structural window size of 512x512 pixels.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Core Framework

* **Primary Language:** Python.
* **GUI Framework:** PyQt6.
* **Namespace Rigor:** Strict usage of scoped enum namespaces within the GUI library (such as explicitly
 utilizing Qt.AlignmentFlag and Qt.Orientation).
* **Target Host & Integration environment:** Dedicated Empyrion: Galactic Survival game server hosted via
 GTXGaming.

## 🏗️ Architectural & File System Constraints

* **Feature-First Pattern:** All application functional logic, controllers, and sub-views are isolated
 cleanly within the /features/ subdirectory. Cross-dependency between distinct features is strictly
  prohibited.
* **Fixed Entry Points & Discovery:** Root paths are locked. Discovery relies explicitly on the fixed
 entry points ZAH.py (Master Lifecycle Orchestrator) and startup.py (Discovery Initialization Script).
* **State Separation Protocol:** Dynamic runtime data, persistent cache databases, configurations, and
 application telemetry (/data, /logs, __pycache__) are strictly excluded from Git tracking via .gitignore.

## 📡 Networking & Server Calibration Constraints

* **Asynchronous Thread Execution:** Multi-threaded architecture is mandatory. Dedicated asynchronous
 background threads handle heavy workloads—such as parsing raw stdout server console logs and broadcasting
  secure live in-game chat—to eliminate UI-thread latency and freeze-ups.
* **GTXGaming Hardware Calibration:** All outbound network command strings pushed to the server must handle
 explicit formatting calibrations:
* Must utilize Windows-style \r\n line terminations.
* Must include a mandatory 500ms input buffer delay between commands.
* **UI Integrity:** Strict reliance on QSS (Qt Style Sheets) border-image properties. This is mandated to prevent high-detail vector asset corner-brackets and custom neon glow textures from warping or stretching across variable monitor resolutions.
* **Fixed Dimensions:** The application orchestrator expects an initial canvas resolution layout of 1000x750 pixels, while specific configuration components like the AccountOnboardingWizard enforce a fixed structural window size of 512x512 pixels.

## 🔄 Automated Lifecycle & Sequential Flows

### 1. Boot Diagnostics & Key Milestone Logic Recap
At 30% Progress: The loader's timing loop pauses and checks if there are accounts with "keep me logged in",
 if there are login screen is bypassed if no then the Login Screen Overlay is activated, Progress bar is kept
  frozen until successful user login or account creation has been verified.

At 60% Progress: The progression bar halts a second time to check if a server configuration profile
 available, conditionally intercepting the initialization of the Network Connection Wizard. If there are
  available network configurations then network wizard is bypassed. If there are no configuration profiles
   available then the network wizard opens for network login data. Progress bar is kept frozen until
    successful configuration profile is found/created. 

Ping is run to verify network configuration. If unable to verify then network wizard is re-initialized with
 ping error and request to re-enter network login info.

At 100% Progress: Upon successfully navigating both state gates, the orchestrator closes the loading phase
 and hands control off over to the main_window cockpit dashboard interface.
